In the eos, at the moment the provenace graph is not perfect because the last structure
(relaxed) is produced giving to scale_to_vol the direct value of the volume, without it
beiing produced by a calcfunction.
To have better graph define
@calcfunction
def extractaval(res_dict):
    return Float(res_dict["fit_res"]["Vo(ang^3/atom)"])
and pass
eqvol = extractaval(res_dict)
eq_structure = scale_to_vol(self.ctx.s0, eqvol)
to get the final structure
