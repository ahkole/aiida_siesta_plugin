In this folder we collect few scripts to show how to run workchains.
Users should take these scripts as templates and adapt them to their own case.
All the other script can be run through:
	runaiida script.py code@computer {stmcode@computer}
However, similarly to the case of plugin examples, the user should make sure that the 
computational resources selected in the script are compatible with their "computer"
(for instance queue and account").
The difference between the scripts "example_*" and "*with_protocol.py" is the fact
that the first set sends a WorkChain with inputs that are all selected inside the script,
the second makes use of the protocol technology to automatically suggest 
inputs for the WorkChain. The protocol approach still leaves compleate freedom
to change the inputs before submission (see relax_with_protocol.py).
